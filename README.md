Learning about quantum computing with Microsoft Q#

ProjectDriver is the project that runs the quantum projects. This needs to be a separate project in .NET 6.
All quantum projects are Q# class libraries.

There is also an option to make runnable Q# projects without .NET driver project, but for now I tried this way first.
